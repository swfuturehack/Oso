There are three main ways that students of all ages can sabotage themselves in exams: poor exam technique, poor revision and weak understanding of the subject itself.

#Revision skills


Good quality revision is vital to exam success. It will take longer than you think, so plan well-ahead and stick to it.

    Make yourself a quiet, distraction-free place to study. Be strong about detaching yourself from social media, and focus. Revising in bed is not the best way either to study or to guarantee a good night’s sleep afterwards.

    Break subjects down into small sections, so that they don’t seem too daunting and you can gradually tick them off one by one and reward yourself. Studies show that if you absorb a chunk of information and then sleep on it, your brain processes it much more efficiently.

    Study past papers and do timed questions to see how you have absorbed the topic. Analyse the sorts of questions they are asking, and look at what you need to know to answer them.

    Try as many ways as you like to remember things – draw pictures and mind maps, use memory tricks such as mnemonic lists, put key points on cards or post-its, read things out to friends or family and test each other, record yourself and play it back, list key facts or themes on your phone and review them on the bus, in the car or on the loo – whatever helps!

    Take regular breaks to stretch, do deep-breathing or meditation, run round the house or talk to someone. This reboots your brain and rests your eyes.
